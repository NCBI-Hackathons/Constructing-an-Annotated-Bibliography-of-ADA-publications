										<td>Hyperuricemia, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and Hypertension: an Emerging Association.</td>
										<td>2017 </td>
										<td>Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are two important public health challenges, and both are linked to increased risk of cardiovascular events. Hyperuricemia has recently emerged as an independent risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension through several proposed mechanisms.</td>

										<td>Metformin is one of the most popular oral glucose-lowering medications, widely considered to be the optimal initial therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ...With no long-term studies comparing it against newer glucose-lowering drugs, some of which have more robust evidence for cardioprotection, metformin's established role as 'foundation therapy' in type 2 diabetes may justifiably be challenged</td>

The current study estimated the burden of disease attributable to type 2 diabetes mellitus and its chronic complications in Brazil, 2008. ...Chronic complications represented 80% of YLDs from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus ranked as a leading health problem in Brazil in 2008, accounting for relevant shares of mortality and morbidity.</td>
