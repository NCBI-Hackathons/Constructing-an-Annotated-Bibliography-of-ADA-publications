Five implants failed, two in the flap group and three in the flapless group (4.34% vs 6.52%, McNemar test P = 1, difference = 0.4457, 95% CI of difference = 4.554 to 47.234). Seven prosthesis failures occurred, three in the flap group and four in the flapless group (McNemar test P = 1; difference = 0.4239; 95% CI of difference = 29.95 to 3.86). Two patients in each group were affected by complications. There were statistically insignificant differences in the incidence of complications between the groups (McNemar test P = 1; difference = 0.457; 95% CI of difference = 90.75 to 5.33). After 24 h, the flapped group patients showed significantly greater pain compared with the flapless group (24 h: P = 0.017, difference = 0.37 and 95% CI = 0.673 to -0.067). After the third and seventh postoperative days, the mean pain level in both groups decreased linearly after the treatments (third day: P = 0.183, difference = 0.19 and 95% CI = -0.472 to 0.092; seventh day: P = 0.225, difference = 0.09 and 95% CI = -0.237 to 0.056). The frequency of post-operative swelling \"some + a lot\" at the third day was significantly higher in the full thickness flap group compared with the flapless group (P = 0.002, difference = 0.1835 and 95% CI = -0.0409 to 0.4079). Most of the cases in either of the study groups demonstrated no swelling (P =1.00, difference = 0.00 and 95% CI = -0.3034 to 0.3034) on the seventh post-operative day. The mean plaque index (6 months: 1.00 \u00b1 0.47 vs 0.83 \u00b1 0.79, P = 0.230, difference = 0.17 and 95% CI = -0.450 to 0.110 and 12 months: 1.30 \u00b1 0.67 vs 1.04 \u00b1 0.86, P = 0.123, difference = 0.26 and 95% CI = 0.593 to 0.073), mean sulcular bleeding index (6 months: 1.40 \u00b1 0.52 vs 1.04 \u00b1 0.83, P = 0.018, difference = 0.36 and 95% CI = 0.658 to 0.062 and 12 months: 1.90 \u00b1 0.48 vs 1.17 \u00b1 0.57, P = < 0.001, difference = -0.73 and 95% CI = -0.958 to -0.503) and pocket depth (6 months: 1.30 \u00b1 0.26 vs 1.17 \u00b1 0.25, P = 0.021, difference = -0.13 and 95% CI = - 0.240 to- 0.012 and 12 months: 1.95 \u00b1 0.28 vs 1.56 \u00b1 0.17, P = < 0.001, difference = -0.39 and 95% CI = -0.490 to -0.290) in both groups increased after the treatment and the increase was evident higher in full thickness flap group than flapless group."
